# SOI-samples
This archive contains rotation samples generated using the Successive Orthogonal Images method. 

Rotation samples are generated for separations of 4-20 degrees and stored as Euler angles (triplet format). 

Code snippets are provided to help you turn the Euler angles into rotation matrices within your own code
